# ASC-MIPS

	This was a project for my Computer Systems Arhitecture class. It is a Verilog specification of a 5-stage pipelined MIPS processor with forwarding and stall-on-branch implemented. For simplicity I/O is managed by files (instruction opcodes are loaded into the Instruction Memory from a file). Tools and materials used for this projects are Vivado Studio and *David A. Patterson & John L. Hennessy - Computer Organization and Design 5th Ed*.
